Marketing and Communications Manager with nearly three years of experience at CDISC, a nonprofit focused on clinical data standards. I specialize in bridging technical and communications work—managing web operations, coordinating with developers, and translating complex subject matter for diverse audiences.

My background includes a Master's degree in Scientific and Technical Communication and hands-on experience across content management systems (Drupal, WordPress, Squarespace), project management tools (JIRA, Asana), and marketing platforms (HubSpot, Google Ads, MailChimp).

This portfolio showcases selected projects in technical project management, marketing operations, and digital experience.
